# algorithm:
# get the prices of a stock for every two minute time interval
# get the prices for t=0, t=2, 
# open_price, closed_price, time
# (price at time=t, price at time=t+2, time t)
# (price at time=t+2, price at time=t+4, time t+2)
# (0,2) (2,4)

# find a way to get current time in python
# find a way to get current time minus 3 days
# find a way to get the stock price for each time
